        <div class="accordion-content about">
          <p>I'm a full-stack developer based in Brussels, Belgium.</p>
          <p>Before becoming a developer I worked in the HR department of companies like Atos and Amazon. It was there
            that I came into contact with programming in an effort to automate some of the repetitive tasks my
            colleagues and I were enduring, first with VBA and later with python.</p>
          <p>When the pandemic hit I decided to take the plunge and go full on webdev with Typescript, Mongo and Node.
          </p>
          <p>Now I get to spend my time learning and creating cool things.</p>
          <p>I'm an avid consumer of media, here are some things I recommend at the moment:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Gaming: Street Fighter 6</li>
            <li>Reading: Children of time ❤️</li>
            <li>Watching: The Bear</li>
          </ul>

        </a>
        <p class="portfolio-first">Fan Academy, a revival of the game Hero Academy by Robot Entertainment. I coded
          the game from scratch following the gameplay and using the assets of the original. The project uses
          Phaser, Express, Colyseus and MongoDB <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Dan-DH/fan-academy/">and its
            code is open source</a>.</p>
        <p>The game counts with a small, dedicated playerbase, which fulfilled my goal of
          reviving a dead game and having someone to play it with :)</p>
